\section{Introduction}
The video game development industry is in a unique position within the encompassing software industry due to the many requirements and demands in producing successful, profitable video games. With demands of performance, expansive content, quick and efficient release cycles, and immersive content, the video game industry has been shifting from the legacy waterfall development methodology to more agile methods such as Scrum that allow these demands to be fulfilled in both a time and cost efficient manner.

Due to the natures of iterative agile development and the presence of unique demands and requirements, the video game development industry must apply unique and innovative solutions to each step of the software process. Furthermore, companies must adapt their creative processes in order to survive in the highly competitive industry.

With the sudden and massive influx of mobile technologies, the need for efficient agile techniques in the video game development industry has amplified further. With relatively short lifecycles and unique input, size, and performance constraints, as well as dealing with a wide range of device hardware, the industryâ€™s development process as a whole has had to adapt in order to survive. We present a subset of these adopted methods and technologies as they pertain to agile development in the video game industry.
