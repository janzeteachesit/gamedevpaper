	There are many facets of game development that make it uniquely challenging. Video games tend to have a much larger emphasis on performance than traditional applications and have much more subjective system requirements. Video game design is also more difficult than traditional software system design due to the complex interactions between objects. Since a large amount of the object interaction in video games happens in the user interface, there are also unique challenges in testing video games. These constraints make video game framework selection much more critical to the success of the game. The creative design process and the ability of the game to immerse its user is also very critical to the success of the game. In this paper we further discuss the unique challenges that game design poses to the software development community.
