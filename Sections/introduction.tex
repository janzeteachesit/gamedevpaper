\section{Introduction}
The video game development industry is in a unique position within the software industry due to the numerous requirements and demands that are required to produce successful, profitable video games. The video game industry has been shifting from the legacy waterfall development methodology to more agile methods such as Scrum which allow the demands of performance, expansive content, quick and efficient release cycles and immersive content to be fulfilled in an efficient manner.

The video game development industry must apply unique and innovative solutions to each step of the software process due to the nature of the agile development process and the unique demands described previously. Furthermore, companies must adapt their creative processes in order to survive in the highly competitive industry.

The sudden influx of mobile technologies has amplified the need for more efficient agile techniques in game development. The game industry's development process has had to adapt to relatively short lifecyles and unique input, size, and performance constraints in order to survive. We present a subset of these adopted methods and technologies as they pertain to agile development in the video game industry.
